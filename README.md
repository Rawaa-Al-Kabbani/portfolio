# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website written using Node.js, Express and Firebase for the backend and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend.

# Pre-requirements

You need a Firebase account and a Firebase configuration file (`firebase-config.json`) to run the website. You also need a `.env` file with the username (`Email-Log`) and password (`Password-Log`) for the admin.

# Instructions

To start the website first install the dependencies with `npm install` and then run `npm start`. The website will run on `http://localhost:2000` by default.
